		<p>Welcome to the Grocery Sales Partner page. By partnering with Zab.ee you will be able to increase your grocery sales exponentially by getting access to regional or national custome base.</p>
		<p>We provide two models for our grocery partners.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>1. Zab.ee Vendor</strong></span><br />You can become Zab.ee vendors and will receive orders placed directly to zab.ee. You will be paid retail prices that are set by Zab.ee for the items minus 12.5% commission. You will handle packing and shipping, however Zab.ee will handle shipping cost. Please note there is no upfront cost, and the commission only applies to actual sales. This is the easiest option for most retailers as they can get started and running and start getting new orders in a matter of days.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2. Zab.ee Seller</strong></span><br />If you have unique brand/products, or you want to set your own prices, you can become online direct seller. In this case, you will be selling on Zab.ee based on brand recognition and/or price. You will set your own prices and will be able to receive orders from all over USA. Zab.ee will take 15% referral commission which will include credit card transaction fee.

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What can you sell?</strong></span></p>
		<p>For local deliveries, you can sell all items including fresh produce, frozen items, and meat. For shipped goods, we are currently limiting to only with dry and non-perishable items.</p>
		<p>The availablity is automatically handled on the website based on delivery method chosen.</p>
		<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Customer Service Guarantee</span></strong></p>
		<p>All Zab.ee Sales partners are expected to comply with the following customer service guarantees.</p>
		<p>1. Shipping within 24 hours except for Sundays and major Holidays.</p>
		<p>2. Reply customer support inquiries within one business day.</p>
		<p>3. Authorize returns within thirty(30) days from customer receiving order.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Shipping:</strong></span></p>
		<p>Packing and shipping is the responsibility of Vendors and Sellers. Zab.ee pays the shipping cost for vendors, while Sellers handle their own shipping cost. However Sellers can utilize Zab.ee partners to get negotiated bulk rates for shipment.</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Payment:</strong></span></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Sales partners are paid on a weekly basis via direct bank deposit to seller account. Each week's proceeds are paid at the beginning of second week. Hence the first payment is processed approximately eight days after the end of week. Please allow at least three business days for the funds to appear in your account. &nbsp;</p>
		<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Escrow:</strong></span></p>
		<p>Zab.ee will keep up to 20% of weekly sales in escrow on rolling basis. This is to allow order defects and return requests. So for example if your first week sales is $1000, your first payment will be $800, If your second week sales is also $1000, your second week payment will be $1000. If you incur no sales in subsequent weeks, the payment for fifth week will be $200, provided there are no customer issues. </p>
		<p>If there are any returns or customer issues deemed the fault of seller, the escrow amount will be used to reimburse customer.</p>
